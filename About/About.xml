        Various small patches/enhancements for Stationeers

        - Show detailed mood and hygiene stats in the tooltips
        - Fix `StackSize` LogicType in IC10 to read the total number of a attached devices in a cable network
        - Fix indirect register access in `l` and `s` IC10 instructions (e.g. `s rr2 Setting 22`)
        - Fix access to defined numbers in `l` and `s` IC10 instructions (e.g. `s MYDEFINE Setting 42`)
        - Rotate content of logic displays if they are mounted upside down (disabled on newer game versions, where it's fixed already)

        These patches/fixes can be enabled/disabled in the StationeersLaunchPad configuration menu at startup.
        This mod
          - Does not alter savegame files, you can add/remove it at any time without breaking something*
          - Is client-only, the server (or other players) do not need it in multiplayer games


        * You will get errors again in IC10 scripts using `StackSize` of cable networks after removing the mod

Various patches for Stationeers.

- Fix `StackSize` LogicType in IC10 to read the total number of a attached devices in a cable network
- Add IC10 instructions for hash evaluation at run-time (highly experimental, just for testing, disabled by default)
- Fix indirect register access in `l` and `s` IC10 instructions (e.g. `s rr2 Setting 22`)
- Fix access to defined numbers in `l` and `s` IC10 instructions (e.g. `s MYDEFINE Setting 42`)
- Rotate content of logic displays if they are mounted upside down (disabled on newer game versions, where it's fixed already)

These patches/fixes can be enabled/disabled in the StationeersLaunchPad configuration menu at startup.
This mod does not change save files, it's safe to add/remove it at any time. Only IC10 scripts using fixed/added instructions will not work anymore, obviously.
