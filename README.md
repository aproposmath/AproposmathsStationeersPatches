# AproposMath's Stationeers Patches

Various patches/enhancements for Stationeers

- Fix `StackSize` LogicType in IC10 to read the total number of a attached devices in a cable network
- Rotate content of logic displays if they are mounted upside down
- Add IC10 instructions for hash evaluation at run-time (highly experimental, just for testing, disabled by default)

These patches/fixes can be enabled/disabled in the StationeersLaunchPad configuration menu at startup.
This mod does not change save files, it's safe to add/remove it at any time. Only IC10 scripts using fixed/added instructions will not work anymore, obviously.

## Installation
This is a **StationeersLaunchPad** Plugin Mod. It requires BepInEx to be installed.
